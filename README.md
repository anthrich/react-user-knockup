Simple user and group management knock up - decided to use react to gain more familiarity with the framework.

Some improvements could be made, given more time:

- Add group form
- State management: a common problem in react (flux, redux etc)
- Some duplication of functionality between UserContainer and GroupContainer
- SCSS is inefficient/repeated in some places.
- Editor for groups/users
